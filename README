General information
-------------------

This is libdebconf-kde, a library which provides a debconf frontend.

A debconf frontend is something similar to a mail server; it gets commands from
a client and replies with a status code followed by a human readable message,
for instance "0 ok". When a program is installed in Debian, the 'config script'
(see man debconf-devel), acts as a client of a debconf frontend. Thus, different
frontends with different kind of user interfaces (kde/qt, gtk, text) can be used
to configure debian packages. This particular frontend is currently used by muon
and apper to configure packages.

While the clients for this protocol are oftenly the config scripts mentioned
above, other programs can use this protocol, for instance apt-listchanges has a
debconf interface, which allows muon to display the apt-listchanges messages
inside the muon user interface

-----------------------------------
Protocol used: the debconf protocol
-----------------------------------

The debconf protocol used by this software is explained here:
* /usr/share/doc/debian-policy/debconf_specification.html
* man 7 debconf-devel

There a are a couple of extensions of the protocol implemented in libdebconf-kde,
specifically these commands:
* X_PING - see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=631769
* X_LOADTEMPLATEFILE - this is used by apt-listchanges, so providing it means
  apt-listchanges messages can be displayed by libdebconf-kde, see:
